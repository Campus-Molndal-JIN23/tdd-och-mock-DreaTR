# Project name
Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Description
- What was your motivation?
To test a web application that uses an external third-party service to retrieve weather forecasts. The application has a class, WeatherService, that calls the external service and returns a forecast based on a specific location. In addition, i wrote a detailed test report based on my tests.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
The goal of this task was to create a series of tests for the WeatherService using JUnit and mock objects. 

- What problem does it solve?
It contributes to better design of the code, the code becomes testable and tested, you build in quality early and prevent poor quality.

- What did you learn?
Writing robust tests for individual classes in a larger application, as well as writing clear and informative test reports.

TDD can improve code quality by ensuring that the code meets its requirements and functions correctly. It also promotes 
better design, increased productivity, and reduces the risk of bugs and regression errors. By integrating TDD into the 
development process, developers can create more robust and reliable software solutions.

Mock objects in testing allows isolation and focus on the code under test, leading to more efficient and accurate testing. 
It also provides flexibility to create different test cases and verify how the code handles different situations. By using 
mock objects, developers can improve test coverage and find bugs and issues more efficiently.

## Installation
- Operating system: Windows, Mac, Linux.
- JDK 20 (Java Development Kit)
- Intellij IDEA Community Edition 2022.1.1
- Git
- Github
- Junit 5

## Run Locally
Libraries
- Maven: org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.9.3
- Maven: org.mockito:mockito-core:5.3.1

JUnit is used to create and run the tests. Mockito is used to create mock objects that simulate calls to the external service,
